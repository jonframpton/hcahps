#### Exploring the HCAHPS Data
I wanted to create a very simple view into the HCAHPS or <strong>Hospital Consumer Assesmment for Healthcare Providers and Systems</strong>.  It seemed like a good data set to play around with and so...

The data was taken from: https://www.healthdata.gov/dataset/search/hcahps
and is represented in a few files.

For the purpose of this fun I focused only on the Hospital based data set.

#### The Fun..
The current implementation of this project is hosted by RStudio on ShinyApps.io:

#### Future Fun.
There is so much to do with this data set, I hope to extend and make this a fun little project to bring some light to the influecning factors of ratings and measures associated with the hospital from the eyes of the users themselves.
